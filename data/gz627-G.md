### [GAS-1] Rearrange struct elements can reduce storage and save gas

Original code: *the struct takes 9 slots*
```solidity

71  struct Settings {
        /// @notice Token Contract to put up for raffle
        address token;  //@audit slot 0
        /// @notice Token ID to put up for raffle
        uint256 tokenId;  //@audit slot 1
        /// @notice Token that each (sequential) ID has a entry in the raffle.
        address drawingToken;  //@audit slot 2
        /// @notice Start token ID for the drawing (if totalSupply = 20 but the first token is 5 (5-25), setting this to 5 would fix the ordering)
        uint256 drawingTokenStartId;  //@audit slot 3
        /// @notice End token ID for the drawing (exclusive) (token ids 0 - 9 would be 10 in this field)
        uint256 drawingTokenEndId;  //@audit slot 4
        /// @notice Draw buffer time – time until a re-drawing can occur if the selected user cannot or does not claim the NFT.
        uint256 drawBufferTime;  //@audit slot 5
        /// @notice block.timestamp that the admin can recover the NFT (as a safety fallback)
        uint256 recoverTimelock;  //@audit slot 6
        /// @notice Chainlink gas keyhash
        bytes32 keyHash;  //@audit slot 7
        /// @notice Chainlink subscription id
        uint64 subscriptionId;  //@audit slot 8
    }
```

Optimized code: *saving 1 slot by moving `subscriptionId` to the second position to share the same slot with `token`*
