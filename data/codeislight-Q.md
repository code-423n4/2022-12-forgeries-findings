- VRFNFTRandomDraw.initialize() lacks checking the existential of drawingTokenStartId and drawingTokenEndId, it is suggested that a staticCall to be made and check if it successed within a try catch block and check the returned value is not equal to zero address in the case of irregular contracts that don't revert on non-existential tokenIds.
- VRFNFTRandomDrawFactory.constructor() needs to ensure code size of _implementation is greater than zero, since it's possible for a non zero address to be an EOA.
- VRFNFTRandomDraw.startDraw() there is no need to check that currentChainlinkRequestId must be equal to zero, since it's alredy checked in _requestRoll internal function.
