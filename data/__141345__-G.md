#### Variable re-arrangement by storage packing

Reference: [Layout of State Variables in Storage](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/internals/layout_in_storage.html).

In `struct Settings`, `uint64 subscriptionId;` can be placed before `address token`, as a result, 1 slot storage can be saved. According to the currently layout, they both occupy 1 slot, but after re-arrangement, they can be packed into 1 slot.

```solidity
File: src/interfaces/IVRFNFTRandomDraw.sol
71:     struct Settings {
72:         /// @notice Token Contract to put up for raffle
73:         address token;
74:         /// @notice Token ID to put up for raffle
75:         uint256 tokenId;
76:         /// @notice Token that each (sequential) ID has a entry in the raffle.
77:         address drawingToken;
78:         /// @notice Start token ID for the drawing (if totalSupply = 20 but the first token is 5 (5-25), setting this to 5 would fix the ordering)
79:         uint256 drawingTokenStartId;
80:         /// @notice End token ID for the drawing (exclusive) (token ids 0 - 9 would be 10 in this field)
81:         uint256 drawingTokenEndId;
82:         /// @notice Draw buffer time â€“ time until a re-drawing can occur if the selected user cannot or does not claim the NFT.
83:         uint256 drawBufferTime;
84:         /// @notice block.timestamp that the admin can recover the NFT (as a safety fallback)
85:         uint256 recoverTimelock;
86:         /// @notice Chainlink gas keyhash
87:         bytes32 keyHash;
88:         /// @notice Chainlink subscription id
89:         uint64 subscriptionId;
90:     }
```
