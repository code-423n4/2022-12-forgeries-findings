Owner doesn't need to own raffled NFT to initialize a NFTRandomDraw contract.
The owner can frontrun the initialize transaction to borrow the NFT so that initialize works, and then sell it in the same block.
Alternatively, he can buy it before the initialization phase and can sell it at a later point, before he calls `startDraw` in `VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol`.
This renders this check useless:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/fc271cf20c05ce857d967728edfb368c58881d85/src/VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol#L132

How this can be fixed is that the NFT transfer can be done in the initialization function - by pre-computing the deployment address of the contract and approving it before `initialize` is called.

Owner can renounce ownership.
The owner of `VRFNFTRandomDraw` contract can perform some privileged activities.
Since he inherits from Openzeppelin's implementation of OwnableUpgradeable, 
he can call `renounceOwnership` at any time to renounce his owner rights, 
leaving the following functions in `VRFNFTRandomDraw.sol` uncallable:
`function startDraw() external onlyOwner returns (uint256)` - line 173
`function redraw() external onlyOwner returns (uint256)` - line 203
`function lastResortTimelockOwnerClaimNFT() external onlyOwner` - line 304
Recommended Mitigation Steps

Either reimplement the function to disable `renounceOwnership` or clearly specify if it is part of the contract design.
